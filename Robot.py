# (/10 points): As a developer, I want a Robot to have a name, health, and a Weapon (this needs to be its own 
#               class and object) with a name (i.e. sword) and attack power. 

# ((/10 points): As a developer, I want the created Robot objects to be stored in a Fleet and the created 
#               Dinosaur objects to be stored in a Herd (the Fleet and Herd must use a List to store the objects).)
# (/10 points): As a developer, I want a Robot to have the ability to attack a Dinosaur and a Dinosaur 
#               to have the ability to attack a Robot on a Battlefield. 
# (/10 points): As a developer, I want a Robot/Dinosaur to lose health points (loss based on attack power) 
#               when another Robot/Dinosaur successfully attacks it. 
# Bonus Points: 
# (/5 points): As a developer, I want a Robot to have the ability to choose from a List of different weapons 
#              that will be then assigned as its own weapon.  
# (/2 points): As a developer, I want a Robot to have a power level and a Dinosaur to have an energy, which 
#              will decrease by 10 every time they attack.
